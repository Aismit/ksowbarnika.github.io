Ok so guys Iâ€™ve decided to change my blog up a bit. Mainly because Iâ€™ve been contemplating a lot on how want to spend my time in college and music has been an important part of my life for as long as I could remember. To give you a little bit of a background, I started vocal training lessons through Carnatic music, a South Indian classical music style, at the age of 5. Lessons have been going on ever since. However, theyâ€™re not as often since college started just because life got in the way ( ðŸ˜¦ ).  Music is my safe haven. Itâ€™s always been this platform that made me feel so comfortable despite any external factors that might be negatively impacting me. Itâ€™s almost as if itâ€™s a crutch for me to lean on when things get personally and/or academically stressful at school. Thatâ€™s precisely why I made the decision to minor in music. It has been especially important lately, as Iâ€™ve started making my own music and thinking about Music as a side gig/hobby. The motivations behind these thoughts would definitely have to do with my acappella group and the extent to which they have supported me.

My first year of college, I tried for multiple acappella groups. Immediately after my first rehearsal, as cheesy as it sounds I knew the people on it would be my life-long friends. Theyâ€™ve been my support system ever since. I think constantly being surrounded by talented artists from freshman year, really motivated me to take music more seriously. Going on a lot of competitions all over the nation with both of the groups taught me so much about just how different a culture can be on a different coast of the SAME country. There so many things left unexplored, and despite the difference in lifestyle and cultures of people from all over, music is a universal language that always seems to connect all of us, that helps us get the right message across. I never posted a New Yearâ€™s resolution/post so hereâ€™s to me continuing to manage both of my passions back and forth as a musical engineer?? Maybe someday we can find an innovative way to combine both of those subjects to bring about a revolutionary product ðŸ˜‰
